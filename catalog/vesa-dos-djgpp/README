DESCRIPTION

A VESA VBE 2.0 video driver for DOS.


DISCLAIMER

This is *very* old code I wrote in 1999. It seems to work fine and you can even
compile and run it in Dosbox. However, I assume no responsibilty for what it
might do to your hardware.


COMPILATION

You need DJGPP, DJ Delorie's DOS port of the gcc, other compilers will *not*
work.

To compile, go to the 'src' folder and type 'make'. Then go to the 'demo\plasma'
folder, for a usage example.
